Merge two branches keeping all commits

- extract all commit not in common
- compute for each commit an hash of content
  (filenames + data hash + permissions)
- class for each commit
  - original hash
  - content hash
  - parents
- group all content hashes
- for each content hash
  - make sure all parent hash have a new commit id
  - if parents have all old commit id equal to old
    update new commit id with old and do nothing
    beside merging possible comments, author, date
  - if not above we must create a new commit,
    do merge and force content to be the same
    (as a safe we should check it)
